House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Unfortunately he is killed.

Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to begin, and let me assure you he will DEFINITELY NOT DIE!

I think he definitely died...
